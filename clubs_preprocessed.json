Founded on May 15, 1851, Alpha Delta Pi is the oldest secret society for college women in the world. Alpha Delta Pi was established at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia by Eugenia Tucker Fitzgerald and five of her friends. As the mother of today's sorority system, it is only fitting that our founding took place at the first college in the world chartered to grant degrees to women. The principles established by our founders in 1851 are enduring standards exemplifying the highest ideals of Christian womanhood. The Zeta Beta chapter of Alpha Delta Pi was founded at North Carolina State University in 1971. The Zeta Beta chapter is the proud 7-time recipient of the prestigious Golden Lion award- an honor that is earned over numerous years and presented by the national level of Alpha Delta Pi. Zeta Beta is also proud to have won the 2013 Sopher Cup!The national philanthropy of Alpha Delta Pi is the Ronald McDonald House. Our chapter is lucky to have a Ronald McDonald house located nearby in Durham where we frequently volunteer to have fun with the families through activity nights, birthday parties, and cooking meals for the families. We support our philanthropy through a variety of fundraisers and fundraising events. Zeta Beta hosts two philanthropy events each year: Ram Roast in the fall semester and Hotcakes for Kids in the spring semester. Ram Roast, an event we host at our house, is a barbecue with proceeds from ticket sales going to the Ronald McDonald House. Our Hotcakes for Kids event takes place at two local McDonald\u2019s where we sell hotcake plates to the public and proceeds also go towards the Ronald McDonald House. We also collect pop-tops from soda cans to raise money and we host percent of purchase nights at popular restaurants to fundraise. These events provide an excellent opportunity to raise funds, involve the community, and spread awareness about the Ronald McDonald House. While our sisters are very active with our philanthropy, they also volunteer for a variety of other charities and programs throughout the year such as the Miracle League, the Special Olympics, and the Salvation Army. While our sisters are involved with our chapter and our philanthropy, they are also very involved on campus and in their academics. From holding positions on a variety of committees in their respective majors, club sports, club cheerleading teams, academic honor societies, and university programs, our sisters stay very active! Zeta Beta not only loves Alpha Delta Pi, but we also love North Carolina State University. Sisters can always be found cheering on the Pack at football games, basketball games, a variety of other sporting events, and by actively participating in the annual Homecoming Competition.

We have maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career.Our heritage stems from one source: young Jewish men banding together in allegiance. The role of Alpha Epsilon Pi has expanded since its inception in 1913. Initially, the Jewish fraternity served as a brotherhood of young men who came from similar religious backgrounds and who had experienced the same prejudices against their religious beliefs. Alpha Epsilon Pi soon broadened its role to include serving as the living quarters for some of its members. The fraternity became a home away from home, providing the same stabilizing and guiding values that students previously gained from their families. Armed with these values, Alpha Epsilon Pi faced changing conditions on the college campus and survived. Today, Jewish students search out Alpha Epsilon Pi because it is a Jewish Fraternity. In the fraternity\u2019s 100-year history, over 93,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each year, over 2,500 undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual adopted decades ago.Perhaps of greater importance, Alpha Epsilon Pi develops leadership for the future of the American Jewish community. Tomorrow\u2019s Jewish leaders are in our chapters today. These are the young men who must be counted upon to support Jewish causes and to prepare to be one of tomorrow\u2019s Jewish leaders, so that they may aid themselves, their family, their community, and their people. Those students who enter the mainstream of non-Jewish life on the campus are far more likely to assimilate and to forsake their heritage. Working together with the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life\/International Hillel, Alpha Epsilon Pi can play a vital role in helping reverse the growing trend among our young people to abandon Judaism at this critical time.Throughout our history, the fraternity setting has served as a \u201clearning laboratory\u201d, a testing ground for young men who later become leaders in business, education, government, religion, and science. A goal of our fraternity is to help each student to develop character, to learn responsibility, and to develop a proper set of values through living together in brotherhood. Alpha Epsilon Pi prepares young men for their role in life as responsible citizens.Therefore, our basic purpose is to provide the opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join a Jewish organization whose purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature. Alpha Epsilon Pi is a Jewish fraternity, though non-discriminatory and open to all who are willing to espouse its purpose and values.","33":"Alpha Gamma Rho (\u0391\u0393\u03a1) is the fraternity sharing a common bond within a dynamic, global agriculture committed to fostering the highest values and providing each and every brother with superior lifelong social and professional success to make better men.","34":"Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated is an international service organization that was founded on the campus of Howard University in Washington, D.C. on January 15, 1908.

More than 60 million girls are out of school around the globe. Education is an answer to many of the global issues related to women \u2013 poverty, oppression, misogyny, brutality. Ultimately, more and more educated girls will mean stronger and healthier villages, communities, and entire countries.Why Sorority Women?Most sororities were founded in the 19th century because of very real obstacles to women achieving a college education. Sorority Founders bound together fiercely to fight for their right to higher education. Today, more than 160 years later, and millions strong, we vow to continue the legacy of our Founders by standing together again to help girls and women go to school around the world. Since the Circle of Sisterhood\u2019s establishment in 2010, sorority communities across the U.S. have engaged in this global humanitarian effort to remove barriers to education for girls in the developing world. This movement by sorority women has already had an impact in 22 countries on 4 continents. 4 Sororities across North America will continue to help domestic U.S. charities in significant ways. The Circle of Sisterhood is a way for our entire community to contribute to the global community \u2013 together. We are a mechanism by which all sorority women can stand together across affiliation, age, color, and creed to make a difference in the lives of millions of girls and women. Collectively, we can do much more than we could as individuals or individual groups. We can give others an equal chance for rewarding lives and livelihoods through schooling, the learning of a trade, or even a college degree. One person can make a small difference. But as a community of educated women, our collective efforts will be transforming for generations to come.","137":"Citizen Science Club works to promote inclusion and expand on interdisciplinary measures in the scientific community.

Wasting viable food is more than just a shame: 17% of landfill methane emissions come from wasted food, and significant amounts of energy and water arewasted in the production and disposal of untouched food.  In addition, 1 in 8 American households are food insecure, meaning they have trouble consistently accessing enough nutritious food. We want to change this by starting with NC State.  Since forming in 2015, the FRN at NC State chapter has redistributed over 16,000 pounds of leftovers from Clark, Fountain, University Towers, athletic events, RAVE catered events, and more.

Once exhausted by their initial resistance, most students frantically tread water, believing it to be the only means of survival. We seek to challenge that by anchoring our lives to a bigger cause - the pursuit of our Creator.Put another way - graduate students typically do not have the time to cater to aspects of life outside of their program, yet those aspects still hold a significant bearing on their life. Things like rest, recreation, food, and community are too often pushed aside in order to do more work. And with all those pushed aside - there's barely any room for larger questions about life as a whole - What is my purpose? What gives life meaning? Seeking these questions is the heart of the matter. Answers to those questions can inject vitality into an otherwise mundane life. Rather than living for the next day, we want to have enough conviction to life fully in the present day - as people with renewed hearts.  As followers of Jesus Christ, we live to daily see his compassion poured out on people. That means it doesn't matter who you are, or what you believe right now. If you're a graduate student and you want life to be about something more than graduate school - this is a place for you. \"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.\"","287":"The Grains of Time are North Carolina\u2019s oldest all-male collegiate a cappella group.

By 1968, director Milton Bliss saw a need for a smaller, more contemporary group to supplement shows performed by the Glee Club, and in November incorporated the inaugural 8 members into what would become known as Grains of Time.Over the decades, the group has undergone many changes, including broadening their repertoire from choral music and \u2018oldies\u2019 to pop, country, hip-hop and R&B, as well as becoming a student-lead organization. What remains the same, though, is perhaps what best defines them- a sense of unity and brotherhood that transcends time and bonds its members unlike anything else.Today, the Grains (as they are referred to by much of their fanbase) continue to entertain with sold-out shows at North Carolina State University and with gigs around North Carolina. They record, compete, and even have toured Europe and taken part in an a cappella competition in Japan.In 2018, the Grains celebrated their 50th anniversary.","288":"With input from people around the world, an international group of leading technological thinkers were asked to identify the Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st century. These 14 game-changing goals for improving life on the planet, announced in 2008, were identified, and the committee suggested these Grand Challenges fall into four cross-cutting themes: , , , and .Currently, engineering education programs in every country prepare students for careers in the culture of the home country, and the US is no exception. At the same time virtually all engineers agree that engineering in the 21st century is global. All engineering students graduating today will work globally, even if they do not believe so at the moment, and hence that it is important to prepare students graduating today for global engagement and the mindset to work anywhere in the world in the 21st Century.  Engineering schools around the nation and the world, and even K-12 programs have adopted the NAE Grand Challenges to inspire practical projects for their students. The GCSP was proposed at the inaugural Summit on the NAE Grand Challenges for Engineering at Duke University, by the deans of the three founding GCSP schools Duke, Olin and USC. In 2009, the NAE moved to endorse this definition of a new engineering education supplement to any engineering program that adds global awareness and social skills with a focus on the Grand Challenges to broaden the reach of undergraduate study in engineering to the global community. This educational supplement is called the Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP).The GCSP simply identifies five competencies that a student must achieve to prepare them to address the Grand Challenges for Engineering found globally. Each adopting university defines its supplemental approach, which NC State has done, to educating its students about each of the five competencies during its undergraduate engineering degree program framework. In brief, the five student competencies in the GCSP are:Talent Competency: mentored research\/creative experience on a Grand Challenge-like topicMultidisciplinary Competency: understanding cross-connectivity and interdisciplinary nature of engineering systems solutions developed through personal engagementViable Business\/Entrepreneurship Competency: understanding, preferably developed though experience, of the necessity of a viable business model for solution implementationMulticultural Competency: understanding different cultures, preferably through multicultural experiences, to ensure cultural acceptance of proposed engineering solutionsSocial Consciousness Competency: understanding that the engineering solutions should primarily serve people and society reflecting social consciousness","289":"Greater Good Textile Group (GGTG) is a campus organization dedicated to spreading the awareness of sustainability in the textile industry while also being a supporting advocate for the ethical and humane treatment of industry workers.

As a student run organization, the SGSA\u2019s primary goal is to ensure that all of our graduate students succeed as they pursue their PhD at NC State. Our constitution states that the purpose of the SGSA is to promote the academic and professional development of all graduate students in sociology. In order to do this, we prioritize fostering an environment that is collaborative rather than competitive. By creating strong relationships with fellow students and faculty, the skills necessary for success can be cultivated. This includes enhanced teaching, publishing, networking, and presentational skills. Beyond developing skills for graduate success, our department is also known for its diverse research interests. Concentrations in one of the following areas are currently available: Crime, Deviance, and Social Control; Food and Environment; Inequality:  Class, Race, and Gender; and Work and the Global Economy. However, regardless of what your academic interests are, our faculty members are often excited to help you explore your own areas of interest. You may also read about the interests of students on our graduate student listing page. The SGSA meets every month to discuss departmental developments. There are several committees within the SGSA that provide opportunities for involvement, including the finance committee, social committee, and professional development committee. These committees work to support graduate students in a variety of ways including providing funding for research, hosting seminars and workshops, and creating opportunities to socialize. One task of the SGSA is to match incoming students with a mentor student already in the program who has interests compatible with your own. The aim of this peer mentor program is to provide new students with the support they need as they enter both a new academic environment and city. Your peer mentor is available to answer any questions you might have about the program, the Raleigh area, or just graduate life. Above all else the SGSA is here to provide our students with a unified voice. If you have already been accepted as an incoming student, congratulations, we look forward to meeting you! If you are currently exploring graduate programs, we hope you will consider us as a competitive match to other universities. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at alcanter@ncsu.edu.

In the U.S. alone, there are at least 125 cases of children born per year with missing fingers on one, or both, of their hands. This loss of function may be restored with a prosthetic device, but the costs are high. The devices are often expensive and children may quickly outgrow them and need to buy another. Many families, therefore, will not be able to provide their child with a needed device. We use 3D printing and other emerging technologies to build prosthetic devices for children in need at no cost to their families. The prosthetic devices are incredibly valuable to the children who receive them and we have seen the biggest smiles on the children\u2019s faces as they receive their device. Not only does the device provide functionality such as picking up a cup or holding a ball, but it delivers the child with a sense of confidence and pride that they never had before. The children have brought their hands to show-and-tell because of how excited and confident they felt having received a device, and they go from hiding their reduced limb to showing off their new device. It brings joy to the children as well as the families who were able to help their children become more confident without any cost to them.","658":"We are igniting the spirit of collaboration here on campus by bringing artistic minds together to make songs, visual art, and generally promote Hip Hop culture.

resistance most students frantically tread water believing it to be the only means of survival we seek to challenge that by anchoring our lives to a bigger cause - the pursuit of our creatorput

recreation food and community are too often pushed aside in order to do more work and with all those pushed aside - there's barely any room for larger questions about life as a whole - what is my purpose what gives life meaning seeking these questions is the heart of the matter answers to those questions can inject vitality into an otherwise mundane life rather than living for the next day we want to have enough conviction to life fully in the present day - as people with renewed hearts  as followers of jesus christ we live to daily see his compassion poured out on people that means it doesn't matter who you are or what you believe right now if you're a graduate student and you want life to be about something more than graduate school - this is a place for you \"the thief comes only
