By changing the way people interact with the pots by altering light, position and how the pots exist in the spaces he creates, he intends to evoke emotion, and feed the viewer enough information so they might take a journey. He speaks of activating the mind in order to create a fuller experience, rather than allowing viewers to make assumptions or approach the work with preconceived notions. His installations often use visual metaphors as an emotional backdrop for the installations. Johnston also notes that his response as an artist is to think about what he does and what it means and to create something that transcends knowledge, which he then communicates to other people.",

By changing the way people interact with the pots by altering light, position and how the pots exist in the spaces he creates, he intends to evoke emotion, and feed the viewer enough information so they might take a journey. He speaks of activating the mind in order to create a fuller experience, rather than allowing viewers to make assumptions or approach the work with preconceived notions. His installations often use visual metaphors as an emotional backdrop for the installations. Johnston also notes that his response as an artist is to think about what he does and what it means and to create something that transcends knowledge, which he then communicates to other people.",

By changing the way people interact with the pots by altering light, position and how the pots exist in the spaces he creates, he intends to evoke emotion, and feed the viewer enough information so they might take a journey. He speaks of activating the mind in order to create a fuller experience, rather than allowing viewers to make assumptions or approach the work with preconceived notions. His installations often use visual metaphors as an emotional backdrop for the installations. Johnston also notes that his response as an artist is to think about what he does and what it means and to create something that transcends knowledge, which he then communicates to other people.",

The talk moves between movies and video games to the brief but memorable fad of screamers found across the internet in the early days of social media. Hart will trace the impact and evolution of the jump scare as the core of a discussion analyzing why anyone would subject themselves to the curiously unpleasant pleasures of horror.",

By changing the way people interact with the pots by altering light, position and how the pots exist in the spaces he creates, he intends to evoke emotion, and feed the viewer enough information so they might take a journey. He speaks of activating the mind in order to create a fuller experience, rather than allowing viewers to make assumptions or approach the work with preconceived notions. His installations often use visual metaphors as an emotional backdrop for the installations. Johnston also notes that his response as an artist is to think about what he does and what it means and to create something that transcends knowledge, which he then communicates to other people.",

The virtual symposium, which will be at 6:30 p.m. April 9, will be the Latin American Student Association's biggest event of the year. The symposium is a great opportunity to showcase Latin American research by graduate students, professors, post-doctoral fellows and other researchers in the U.S. It is also an excellent chance to meet fellow Latin Americans, exchane ideas with fellow students and faculty, network with academic members in the Triangle area and practice your communication and oral presentation skills.\n\nYour presentation can be about your current research or research project (if you don't have data). Your abstract should have a maximum of 300 words. Late submissions will be accepted.",
