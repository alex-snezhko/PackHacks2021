One is the a booth where we run a privately owned \"Agri-Pride Simulator\" that mimics a real crop harvester that people of all ages can sit in and view first hand how specific crops are actually harvested. Also, we have a children's activity where children participate in a crop themed trivia game where they can win candy and other goodies for their efforts. Additionally, we preserve our farmland and natural resources by constantly advocating for these areas at any level we can. We make long strides of effort to educate the public on how beneficial these resources are to everyone. Finally, we do not only encourage service, we are servants of our community. We participate often in \"Warmth for Wake\". This is a firewood ministry for Wake County where we club members help cut, split, and deliver firewood to low incomes households free of charge. Also, we go to the Governor Morehead School of the Blind where we set up an activity for the students to feel the different crop seeds as an agricultural teaching tool.Even though the club is so involved in all of these unique activites to back our mission statement, we work to professionally develop our members through bi-weekly meetings where we have a guest speaker from various sectors of the agriculture world. Also, we sponsor 6 of our student members to attend the national SASES (Students of Agronomy and Environmental Sciences) Conference where members can participate in many things such as an agriculture quiz bowl, crops judging contest, and so forth. In 2018, the Agronomy Club at NC State placed fourth at the conference which heralded us as the fourth best Agronomy Club in the nation.",

        "desc": "First, Finest, Forever. Founded on May 15, 1851, Alpha Delta Pi is the oldest secret society for college women in the world. Alpha Delta Pi was established at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia by Eugenia Tucker Fitzgerald and five of her friends. As the mother of today's sorority system, it is only fitting that our founding took place at the first college in the world chartered to grant degrees to women. The principles established by our founders in 1851 are enduring standards exemplifying the highest ideals of Christian womanhood. The Zeta Beta chapter of Alpha Delta Pi was founded at North Carolina State University in 1971. The Zeta Beta chapter is the proud 7-time recipient of the prestigious Golden Lion award- an honor that is earned over numerous years and presented by the national level of Alpha Delta Pi. Zeta Beta is also proud to have won the 2013 Sopher Cup!The national philanthropy of Alpha Delta Pi is the Ronald McDonald House. Our chapter is lucky to have a Ronald McDonald house located nearby in Durham where we frequently volunteer to have fun with the families through activity nights, birthday parties, and cooking meals for the families. We support our philanthropy through a variety of fundraisers and fundraising events. Zeta Beta hosts two philanthropy events each year: Ram Roast in the fall semester and Hotcakes for Kids in the spring semester. Ram Roast, an event we host at our house, is a barbecue with proceeds from ticket sales going to the Ronald McDonald House. Our Hotcakes for Kids event takes place at two local McDonald\u2019s where we sell hotcake plates to the public and proceeds also go towards the Ronald McDonald House. We also collect pop-tops from soda cans to raise money and we host percent of purchase nights at popular restaurants to fundraise. These events provide an excellent opportunity to raise funds, involve the community, and spread awareness about the Ronald McDonald House. While our sisters are very active with our philanthropy, they also volunteer for a variety of other charities and programs throughout the year such as the Miracle League, the Special Olympics, and the Salvation Army. While our sisters are involved with our chapter and our philanthropy, they are also very involved on campus and in their academics. From holding positions on a variety of committees in their respective majors, club sports, club cheerleading teams, academic honor societies, and university programs, our sisters stay very active! Zeta Beta not only loves Alpha Delta Pi, but we also love North Carolina State University. Sisters can always be found cheering on the Pack at football games, basketball games, a variety of other sporting events, and by actively participating in the annual Homecoming Competition. ADPi always backs the Pack!Alpha Delta Pi is something you are, not just something you become. At North Carolina State University, by living by this motto our lives are enriched by true friendships and unselfish service to our community. Through Alpha Delta Pi our sisters establish not only close friendships, but also a strong sisterhood that lasts a lifetime. We live for each other, and for Alpha Delta Pi.

        "desc": "Alpha Epsilon Pi was founded to provide opportunities for the Jewish college man seeking the best possible college and fraternity experience. We have maintained the integrity of our purpose by strengthening our ties to the Jewish community and serving as a link between high school and career.Our heritage stems from one source: young Jewish men banding together in allegiance. The role of Alpha Epsilon Pi has expanded since its inception in 1913. Initially, the Jewish fraternity served as a brotherhood of young men who came from similar religious backgrounds and who had experienced the same prejudices against their religious beliefs. Alpha Epsilon Pi soon broadened its role to include serving as the living quarters for some of its members. The fraternity became a home away from home, providing the same stabilizing and guiding values that students previously gained from their families. Armed with these values, Alpha Epsilon Pi faced changing conditions on the college campus and survived. Today, Jewish students search out Alpha Epsilon Pi because it is a Jewish Fraternity. In the fraternity\u2019s 100-year history, over 93,000 men have worn the badge of Alpha Epsilon Pi and each year, over 2,500 undergraduates perform the Ritual of Initiation, which remains the same ritual adopted decades ago.Perhaps of greater importance, Alpha Epsilon Pi develops leadership for the future of the American Jewish community. Tomorrow\u2019s Jewish leaders are in our chapters today. These are the young men who must be counted upon to support Jewish causes and to prepare to be one of tomorrow\u2019s Jewish leaders, so that they may aid themselves, their family, their community, and their people. Those students who enter the mainstream of non-Jewish life on the campus are far more likely to assimilate and to forsake their heritage. Working together with the Foundation for Jewish Campus Life/International Hillel, Alpha Epsilon Pi can play a vital role in helping reverse the growing trend among our young people to abandon Judaism at this critical time.Throughout our history, the fraternity setting has served as a \u201clearning laboratory\u201d, a testing ground for young men who later become leaders in business, education, government, religion, and science. A goal of our fraternity is to help each student to develop character, to learn responsibility, and to develop a proper set of values through living together in brotherhood. Alpha Epsilon Pi prepares young men for their role in life as responsible citizens.Therefore, our basic purpose is to provide the opportunity for a Jewish man to be able to join a Jewish organization whose purpose is not specifically religious, but rather social and cultural in nature. Alpha Epsilon Pi is a Jewish fraternity, though non-discriminatory and open to all who are willing to espouse its purpose and values.",

Instead, members can connect on Discord.  Members may watch shows together on Thursdays via SyncPlay or by themselves via a method of their choice.     This week's schedule (3-26):Eden of the East 8Drifters 8Kamichu (Comedy, Drama, Slice of Life, Supernatural)Space Dandy S2: E8 (Space, Comedy, Sci-Fi) Ongoing shows:Eden of the East (Action, Sci-Fi, Mystery, Drama, Romance, Thriller)Drifters (Action, Adventure, Comedy, Historical, Samurai, Fantasy, Seinen) Club Discord: Anime Club at NCSUClub MAL: AnimeClubAtNCSUClub Facebook: Anime Club @ncsu  Mission:The purpose of this club is to provide a social environment to watch anime.  Those who are interested in manga and video games are also encouraged to join.  Anime Club also strives to provide a place for people to interact with others who are passionate about niche Japanese culture.  How Things RollOur club aims to have a chill and relaxed atmosphere for anyone who would like to come by.  Feel free to just come to meet people, have a different atmosphere to study/do work, or whatever else you'd like.  If the club isn't to your liking, you are welcome to leave whenever you wish.Our other objective is to expose anime lovers to shows they may have easily missed or are not well known.  This being said, we try to avoid showing mainstream or other popular anime that most people have likely seen (Ex: Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Fairy Tail, FMA/FMAB, Death Note, Attack on Titan, My Hero Academia, etc.).  Feel free to discuss these shows, but we will most likely not be showing them in club.On the first day of club, the officers and president will select 4 shows we deem appropriate for watching on a weekly basis.  After watching the first episode of each, members will vote on the two they would like to watch every week and the two highest voted shows will make the cut.Our formal meeting on Thursdays consists of watching 4 episodes of anime. The first and last episodes we watch will be our weekly series.  The other 2 episodes will be the first episodes of member-voted series.Every week after watching the first 2 episodes, we will have a brief intermission for socializing.  We will then pick 8 people to recommend 8 different shows, of which we will then vote upon.  Next week, we will watch the 2 shows with the greatest number of votes.Once a semester, we will have an Anime Trivia Night or Name That Tune.  Typically, Anime Trivia Night is held in the fall around Fall Break or Thanksgiving Break, while Name That Tune is held around Spring Break or Easter Vacation.  Anime Trivia Night and Name That Tune are always held on a Monday night.  Winners will receive grand prizes; other participants will receive consolation prizes.On the last Thursday of each semester, we watch a movie.  Drinks and snacks will be provided, but feel free to bring your own as well.There are a few notable rules:Respect one another.  This is quite important, especially because not all people have the same taste in anime.  Let's keep things civil.  No bashing shows/waifus/husbandos/ships/etc.Any show suggestion that the officers and/or the president deem inappropriate is subject to immediate revocation.  These include (but are not limited to) hentai or other overly sexual/ecchi anime (Ex: High School DxD, To LOVE-Ru, Monster Musume, etc.) and anime that attack sensitive topics such as race, sexual orientation, and/or religion (Ex: Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt).  Fanservice here and there is inevitable in most anime, so some will be overlooked, but those that are too sexually gratuitous will be vetoed.Please avoid talking/commenting on the shows we watch until halftime.  An occasional comment to a friend whispered here or there is fine, but otherwise try not to chat during the shows.Following Thursday meetings, we go out to eat dinner at Golden Dragon on Hillsborough Street.  However, feel free to order take-out anywhere we don't go and join us afterwards.  Drinks are free for club members because we bring in such a large crowd every Thursday.  The informal Monday meetings are primarily for hanging out with everyone.  Video games will be set up (generally anime-style fighting games such as Smash or Project Diva) for anyone to enjoy.  We also play Weiss Schwarz, the anime trading card game, so if you already play or are interested in getting into the game, come join us!  Funny/Interesting anime videos and/or trivia sites are often explored as well.  Feel free to come and go as you please.  We usually go eat somewhere on Western Boulevard afterwards.  Some of the officers and club members have cars and are willing to provide transportation.Above all else, we hope you enjoy the club!",

At North Carolina State University, the student chapters of these two organizations are combined (with two sets of officers) and serve students as a joint body, the NCSU Student ACM/AITP. As an active part of the Computer Science Department here at NC State, ACM/AITP provides opportunities throughout the year for students to get involved in their department and learn about the exciting job opportunities awaiting them in this growing field. Every year we host a number of companies, including many of the leading names in the industry such as Microsoft, Intel, IBM, and others, providing both valuable information about job opportunities and information about the latest developments in computing technology. Also sponsored are talks by professors and others in the NCSU community allowing us to see what's going on in our own backyard. Topics in the past have included network security, 3D graphics, and artificial intelligence. Every spring we have a food and a fun filled end-of-year Pig Pickin' for the Computer Science Department, and we usually sponsor various other activities throughout the year.",

Ultimately, more and more educated girls will mean stronger and healthier villages, communities, and entire countries.Why Sorority Women?Most sororities were founded in the 19th century because of very real obstacles to women achieving a college education. Sorority Founders bound together fiercely to fight for their right to higher education. Today, more than 160 years later, and millions strong, we vow to continue the legacy of our Founders by standing together again to help girls and women go to school around the world. Since the Circle of Sisterhood\u2019s establishment in 2010, sorority communities across the U.S. have engaged in this global humanitarian effort to remove barriers to education for girls in the developing world. This movement by sorority women has already had an impact in 22 countries on 4 continents. 4 Sororities across North America will continue to help domestic U.S. charities in significant ways. The Circle of Sisterhood is a way for our entire community to contribute to the global community \u2013 together. We are a mechanism by which all sorority women can stand together across affiliation, age, color, and creed to make a difference in the lives of millions of girls and women. Collectively, we can do much more than we could as individuals or individual groups. We can give others an equal chance for rewarding lives and livelihoods through schooling, the learning of a trade, or even a college degree. One person can make a small difference. But as a community of educated women, our collective efforts will be transforming for generations to come.",

TJ's Night Life in North Raleigh is our host facility, and we meet on the first Thursdays of each month during the academic school year, starting at 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM. Don't know how? Don't worry, our community is full of swing-stepping students that are ready to show you how it's done!",

Untold acres of wetland habitat vanished in the 1930s, taking with them the promise of generations of waterfowl. In 1937, a small group of conservationists who realized that the majority of North America's waterfowl breed in the Canadian prairies, organized to raise money in the United States for waterfowl conservation in Canada. It was the unique idea that became Ducks Unlimited. Ducks Unlimited's Vision & Mission The vision of Ducks Unlimited is wetlands sufficient to fill the skies with waterfowl today, tomorrow and forever. Singleness of Purpose - Our Mission Ducks Unlimited conserves, restores and manages wetlands and associated habitats for North America's waterfowl.

We seek to challenge that by anchoring our lives to a bigger cause - the pursuit of our Creator.Put another way - graduate students typically do not have the time to cater to aspects of life outside of their program, yet those aspects still hold a significant bearing on their life. Things like rest, recreation, food, and community are too often pushed aside in order to do more work. And with all those pushed aside - there's barely any room for larger questions about life as a whole - What is my purpose? What gives life meaning? Seeking these questions is the heart of the matter. Answers to those questions can inject vitality into an otherwise mundane life. Rather than living for the next day, we want to have enough conviction to life fully in the present day - as people with renewed hearts.  As followers of Jesus Christ, we live to daily see his compassion poured out on people. That means it doesn't matter who you are, or what you believe right now. If you're a graduate student and you want life to be about something more than graduate school - this is a place for you. \"The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

By 1968, director Milton Bliss saw a need for a smaller, more contemporary group to supplement shows performed by the Glee Club, and in November incorporated the inaugural 8 members into what would become known as Grains of Time.Over the decades, the group has undergone many changes, including broadening their repertoire from choral music and \u2018oldies\u2019 to pop, country, hip-hop and R&B, as well as becoming a student-lead organization. What remains the same, though, is perhaps what best defines them- a sense of unity and brotherhood that transcends time and bonds its members unlike anything else.Today, the Grains (as they are referred to by much of their fanbase) continue to entertain with sold-out shows at North Carolina State University and with gigs around North Carolina. They record, compete, and even have toured Europe and taken part in an a cappella competition in Japan.In 2018, the Grains celebrated their 50th anniversary.",

        "desc": "With input from people around the world, an international group of leading technological thinkers were asked to identify the Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st century. These 14 game-changing goals for improving life on the planet, announced in 2008, were identified, and the committee suggested these Grand Challenges fall into four cross-cutting themes: , , , and .Currently, engineering education programs in every country prepare students for careers in the culture of the home country, and the US is no exception. At the same time virtually all engineers agree that engineering in the 21st century is global. All engineering students graduating today will work globally, even if they do not believe so at the moment, and hence that it is important to prepare students graduating today for global engagement and the mindset to work anywhere in the world in the 21st Century.  Engineering schools around the nation and the world, and even K-12 programs have adopted the NAE Grand Challenges to inspire practical projects for their students. The GCSP was proposed at the inaugural Summit on the NAE Grand Challenges for Engineering at Duke University, by the deans of the three founding GCSP schools Duke, Olin and USC. In 2009, the NAE moved to endorse this definition of a new engineering education supplement to any engineering program that adds global awareness and social skills with a focus on the Grand Challenges to broaden the reach of undergraduate study in engineering to the global community. This educational supplement is called the Grand Challenges Scholars Program (GCSP).The GCSP simply identifies five competencies that a student must achieve to prepare them to address the Grand Challenges for Engineering found globally. Each adopting university defines its supplemental approach, which NC State has done, to educating its students about each of the five competencies during its undergraduate engineering degree program framework. In brief, the five student competencies in the GCSP are:Talent Competency: mentored research/creative experience on a Grand Challenge-like topicMultidisciplinary Competency: understanding cross-connectivity and interdisciplinary nature of engineering systems solutions developed through personal engagementViable Business/Entrepreneurship Competency: understanding, preferably developed though experience, of the necessity of a viable business model for solution implementationMulticultural Competency: understanding different cultures, preferably through multicultural experiences, to ensure cultural acceptance of proposed engineering solutionsSocial Consciousness Competency: understanding that the engineering solutions should primarily serve people and society reflecting social consciousness",

In the Human Factors and Applied Cognition Program, there is an emphasis on cognitive engineering/HF in systems design, industrial ergonomics/biomechanics, and occupational safety and health. Students gain breadth of knowledge of physical ergonomics, understanding of approaches to usability evaluation and interface design for human-machine systems, and methods for recognition, evaluation and control of safety hazards in complex task environments. Goal is broad preparation. Courses emphasize contemporary theory, concepts and principles; observational methodologies and research techniques; and systems approach to analysis, design and modeling. Additional courses may be taken in variety of fields, including biomedical engineering, computer science, epidemiology, industrial hygiene, psychology, and public health. (Several courses through ISE program are cross-listed with Psychology.) For superior students, direct-track PhD program exists (MS degree must be completed along the way). Being a member of the HFES organization increases knowledge of these skills, provides opportunities for connections, and enhances the overall research experience. NCSU is recognized as one of the schools in the United States to have a Human Factors graduate program and providing these students with an organization to explore opportunities and connections is something that HFES strives to achieve.",

The NCSU Chapter is one of the largest student chapters in the country and by far the largest in the south. Our main goal is to build your network, introduce you to the leading professionals in the area, and land you an internship, co-op, or full time position in the thriving biotechnology industry while providing a fun and inviting club atmosphere. ISPE offers around 2-3 general meetings a month in addition to 1-2 workshops each semester, company tours, service events and social events both within the club and with other student organizations on campus. We bring in professionals from companies around the area to speak and network with YOU about what they do. Free food at all meetings doesn't hurt either, right?

An idea that would cater to the needs of these women as they are making their way through seemly endless labyrinth we know be college. This vision manifested itself as Lambda Theta Alpha, the 1st Latin Sorority in the Nation. Over 40 years later, Lambda Theta Alpha continues to thrive as one of the largest traditionally Latin based Sorority in the nation. Not catering only to Latinas, but to all women regardless of their race, creed or sexual orientation. LTA is Latin by Tradition, Not Definition. We are scholars who take pride in giving back to our communities as well as promoting unity through charitable and educational programs. We are campus leaders who provide and participate in political, social, and cultural activities. Most importantly, we are sisters of an organization that changes lives. On behalf of the Epsilon Nu Chapter of Lambda Theta Alpha at NC State, we would like to thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about our remarkable organization.",

Lion Dancing may be seen only for its purpose of lifting up the spirits to create a festive atmosphere during celebrations; however, it is actually deeply rooted in its culture as it combines art, history, and martial arts. Lion Dancing comes from a rich history, ranging over a thousand years, dating back to before the Tang Dynasty. The decorative lion costumes demonstrate the meticulous designs the artist crafted, exposing symbolic colors tied closely with the Chinese culture. Each precise movement by the performers take years to perfect, revealing the remarkable martial arts agility needed to accomplish each of these motions. Everyday, the culture that our ancestors have worked to build is lost a little bit more. By simply asserting our presence, and performing Lion Dance to our community and world, we contribute the survival of a deeply rooted culture, appreciated by countless groups of people. Our goal is to travel in our local and state regions to raise this awareness for the survival of culture and build connections with other individuals or groups who have the same hope and wish.",

We are always looking for new, dedicated members and now is a great time to join, as you\u2019ll be immediately connected with other students, of varied ages and majors, capable of mentoring you. R&D Club was developed for students who want to work on real world projects, but still be able to have a flexible schedule. We do as much conversation and work as possible over web-based apps and programs so no one is bound by their school/work schedules. We send out tasks every other week and if work is assigned to a small group, we encourage meetings, but do not require them. We train every member on any knowledge and skills they might need for any task being assigned to them. Our current project is the design and development of a CNC Mill.The overall goal of this project is to learn and explore cutting edge design techniques and incorporate new technology into a useful machine. If you don't know what a CNC Milling Machine is, that's okay, there is no prior experience, knowledge, or major necessary for joining this club. Unlike 3-D printing that adds material layer by layer, a CNC milling machine takes a block of material and cuts excess material away to obtain a desired shape. This is a substantial project that will require a good amount of time and effort, but I think you'll find that what you learn along the way is well worth it.

As a student run organization, the SGSA\u2019s primary goal is to ensure that all of our graduate students succeed as they pursue their PhD at NC State. Our constitution states that the purpose of the SGSA is to promote the academic and professional development of all graduate students in sociology. In order to do this, we prioritize fostering an environment that is collaborative rather than competitive. By creating strong relationships with fellow students and faculty, the skills necessary for success can be cultivated. This includes enhanced teaching, publishing, networking, and presentational skills. Beyond developing skills for graduate success, our department is also known for its diverse research interests. Concentrations in one of the following areas are currently available: Crime, Deviance, and Social Control; Food and Environment; Inequality:  Class, Race, and Gender; and Work and the Global Economy. However, regardless of what your academic interests are, our faculty members are often excited to help you explore your own areas of interest. You may also read about the interests of students on our graduate student listing page. The SGSA meets every month to discuss departmental developments. There are several committees within the SGSA that provide opportunities for involvement, including the finance committee, social committee, and professional development committee. These committees work to support graduate students in a variety of ways including providing funding for research, hosting seminars and workshops, and creating opportunities to socialize. One task of the SGSA is to match incoming students with a mentor student already in the program who has interests compatible with your own. The aim of this peer mentor program is to provide new students with the support they need as they enter both a new academic environment and city. Your peer mentor is available to answer any questions you might have about the program, the Raleigh area, or just graduate life. Above all else the SGSA is here to provide our students with a unified voice. If you have already been accepted as an incoming student, congratulations, we look forward to meeting you! If you are currently exploring graduate programs, we hope you will consider us as a competitive match to other universities. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at alcanter@ncsu.edu. Sincerely,Brooke Graham2019-2020 SGSA President",

Afterwards, we plan to transition into an interaction between our NC State college community and the local handicapped community. This will include an assortment of service events such as: Autism awareness walks/runs, volunteering at Meredith College\u2019s autism program, working with Miracle League of the Triangle and Special Olympics,  Carolina Dance Center, Special Blessings, and so many more! In addition, we plan to host fundraising events for underprivileged families raising disabled children.

In the U.S. alone, there are at least 125 cases of children born per year with missing fingers on one, or both, of their hands. This loss of function may be restored with a prosthetic device, but the costs are high. The devices are often expensive and children may quickly outgrow them and need to buy another. Many families, therefore, will not be able to provide their child with a needed device. We use 3D printing and other emerging technologies to build prosthetic devices for children in need at no cost to their families. The prosthetic devices are incredibly valuable to the children who receive them and we have seen the biggest smiles on the children\u2019s faces as they receive their device. Not only does the device provide functionality such as picking up a cup or holding a ball, but it delivers the child with a sense of confidence and pride that they never had before. The children have brought their hands to show-and-tell because of how excited and confident they felt having received a device, and they go from hiding their reduced limb to showing off their new device. It brings joy to the children as well as the families who were able to help their children become more confident without any cost to them.",

It is a continuous process that starts when we begin our relationship with God and continues until we see God face to face. 2 Tim 1:9; 1 Pet 1:15b-16; Heb 12:14.Justice: Seeking justice is seeking to value, hold as worthy and treat with dignity every human being as made in the image of God. Therefore each is equally valuable, worthy of life and to be treated with dignity. When a group or an individual is wronged or oppressed it is our responsibility as disciples of Christ to advocate for the righteous treatment of their humanity. Micah 6:8, Psalms 82: 3-4.Missions: Impact invites students to take the good news of Jesus Christ, through word and actions, to those who haven\u2019t heard; locally, nationally and globally. Acts 1:8, Matt 24:14.Prayer: Prayer is an intimate (speaking and listening) conversation with God, through which God and the believer engage in relationship, individually and corporately. Philippians 4:4-7; Colossians 1:1-9; 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18.Stewardship: Our life and lifestyle are not our own but God\u2019s. We live as managers of resources (time, relationships, talents, education, career, gifts, money, etc), understanding that we will account for utilizing all God has entrusted to us for the Lord\u2019s glory and the benefit of others. Acts 4:32-37, 2 Corinthians 9:6-15.",

We have fixed-wing, helicopter, and glider pilots who would love to share their stories and pictures from training and past flights as well as instructors that can guide you in choosing a school. If you just want to go for a ride, most pilots would be more than happy to show off their skills if you ask nicely. Interested in industry? We plan to partner with other flying clubs and organizations in the area to plan lectures with speakers from all aspects of the aviation industry. Raleigh is teeming with companies that play an important part in general and commercial aviation and if people are interested, we can plan for tours of the local facilities.Interested in working for the FAA? We will take advantage of the fact that RDU is only a short drive away and plan tours for anyone interested in either working in an airport or the FAA. Tours of the air traffic control tower and other airport facilities are available to anyone interested. Tours of other local airports are also available with some hands-on training in the Wings of Carolina hangar for anyone interested in aircraft maintenance (how hard could it be to change the spark plugs on a 50-year-old engine?).Interested in meteorology or weather? The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a weather service station tucked away on Centennial campus which gives us the advantage of being able to just walk over!

For more information on our chapter please visit our website or contact our president at ncsu.zta.president@gmail.com",
